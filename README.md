I'm working on developing a table-top star-fighter game a bit like X-wing. But this project started just building a script to test a couple of hundred efforts and display the results. Things like 10,000 shots taken by someone who is gunnery skill 6, how many times do they hit their target? Etc.

Well, the project grew a bit and now I'm working with objects. The class I took touched on objects.... but only just. So most of this is from my efforts of reading online tutorials. Anyway, just tossing it up for review and feedback. Not having any problems with it, at least not yet anyway.

So the purpose of this project is to build a program that will allow me to facilitate shooting and dodging tests based on the rules I've developed for the table top game.
